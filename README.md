This repository contains computer programs written and used by 
[Xinming Wu](http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/wu/) 
for 3D seismic structure- and stratigraphy-oriented smoothing that is 
  discussed in our Geophysics paper 
[Detecting faults and channels while enhancing seismic structural and stratigraphic features
](https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/int-2017-0174.1).
